# MatchReverb
Match a target Impulse Response with an FDN

todo: 

- test all the impulse responses and get data out of it (On PC)
- plotting the error for all the impulse responses in meaningful way
- get different runs and see if the error varies between runs (what is the lowest we can get)
- establish links between the results and where the error is (short impulse or large)
- plot the error Vs global RT60
- explore in details the results of the dataset
- quick prototype of the early reflection devices (On mac)

try to see if there is a 10 log(x) that should be turned into a 20 log(x) or
the other way around... especially for the rt30 and spectrum...

... interesting. it does seem to make a difference 
let's try to use this as a measure and see if it reduces the error on one impulse response.
